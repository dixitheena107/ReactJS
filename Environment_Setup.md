## Setting up a React Environment
If you have NPM and Node.js installed, you can create a React application by first *installing the create-react-app*.

If you've already created the create-react-app you can skip this section.

#### Install create-react-app by running this command in your terminal:

C:\Users\Your Name>npm install -g create-react-app
Then you are able to create a React application, let's create one called myfirstreact.

#### Run this command to create a React application named myfirstreact:

C:\Users\Your Name>npx create-react-app myfirstreact
The create-react-app will set up everything you need to run a React application.

#### Run the React Application
Now you are ready to run your first real React application!

#### Run this command to move to the myfirstreact directory:

C:\Users\Your Name>cd myfirstreact
#### Run this command to run the React application myfirstreact:

C:\Users\Your Name\myfirstreact>npm start
#### A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! If not, open your browser and type localhost:3000 in the address bar.
